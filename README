# Basic Serial Proxy

Several useful retro terminal emulators, such as Mittenterm, are unable to directly talk to 
serial devices on all platforms (such as sandboxed macOS).

This is a basic serial proxy for connecting a serial port to a network.

## Building

1.  Install Go.  This is often most easily accomplished through a [package management tool such as Brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/go)
2.  cd to the `cmd` directory of the git: `cd cmd`
3.  Build the forwarder: `go build serialfwd`

## Using

The serial forwarder connects the serial port to a TCP network port.  

To find the serial interface, look in `/dev`; typically on macOS they will be named `/dev/cu.usbserial-FOO`

Using Mittenterm or other terminal tools, connect to the proxy at `localhost` on the port specified, by default, `8888`.

```
Usage of ./serialfwd:
  -device string
    	Path to serial port (typically /dev/cu.usbserial-SOMETHING) (default "/dev/cu.usbserial-foo")
  -help
    	Help
  -list
    	List serial ports
  -port string
    	TCP port (default "8888")
  -speed int
    	Serial port speed (default 9600)
```
